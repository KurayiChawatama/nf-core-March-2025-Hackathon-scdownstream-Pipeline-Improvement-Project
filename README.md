# 🔬 nf-core March 2025 Hackathon Project: Enhancing the nf-core/scdownstream Pipeline

Welcome to our nf-core hackathon March 2025 project! This repository contains collaborative work to **improve the [nf-core/scdownstream](https://github.com/nf-core/scdownstream) pipeline** by expanding tool diversity, improving support for model organisms, and enhancing user accessibility.

## Important Note

**This repo is for project coordination only!**

🔧 **Code contributions happen here: [scdownstream fork](https://github.com/KurayiChawatama/scdownstream)**

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. **🔍 Doublet Detection**
   - **Add support for scDblFinder**, a highly regarded R-based tool for doublet detection in single-cell RNA-seq data.
   - Benchmarks show scDblFinder outperforms several tools currently included in the pipeline.

2. **🧬 Species Support Expansion**
   - Expand support for **non-human species**, particularly **mouse**, using resources like **Tabula Muris Senis**.
   - Ideal for contributors familiar with scRNA-seq data analysis from model organisms.

3. **📖 Documentation and Accessibility**
   - Improve usage docs and onboarding materials.
   - Make the pipeline more accessible for first-time contributors.

## ⚙️ Recommended Development Workflow

This project involves:
- Adding/testing new tools (like **scDblFinder**).
- Editing and validating **nf-core modules**.
- Working with **R and Python-based tools**.
- Fast iteration and troubleshooting.

### 🚧 Development Setup

We recommend the following workflow:

1. **Use Conda for local development**
   - Create an isolated environment for modifying/testing dependencies.
   - Activate the environment before working.

2. **Use Docker for reproducible final validation**
   - Once the pipeline is stable, switch to containers for robust testing.

## 🧪 Suggested Conda Environment

Create your dev environment using the following `scdev.yml`:

```yaml
name: scdev
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - bioconda
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - python=3.12
  - nextflow
  - nf-core
  - mamba
  - r-base
  - r-devtools
  - r-optparse
  - r-tidyverse
  - bioconductor-scdblfinder
  - bioconductor-singlecellexperiment
  - bioconductor-scran
  - r-seurat
  - jupyterlab
  - git
```

Install via:

```bash
mamba env create -f scdev.yml
conda activate scdev
```
## 💻 Launching R Studio from Conda Environment

Run RStudio using the R inside your Conda env:

```bash
RSTUDIO_WHICH_R=/home/your_username/miniconda3/envs/scdev/bin/R rstudio
```

## 🧵 Keeping RStudio Running with tmux (Optional but Recommended)

1. Install tmux:
```bash
sudo apt install tmux
```
2. Create a new session:

```bash
tmux new -s rstudio_session
```
3. Inside tmux:

```bash
conda activate scdev
RSTUDIO_WHICH_R=/home/your_username/miniconda3/envs/scdev/bin/R rstudio
```

4. Detach from the session (RStudio stays running):

```
Ctrl + B, then press D
```

5. Reattach later:

```bash
tmux attach -t rstudio_session
```

To list or kill sessions:

```bash
tmux ls
tmux kill-session -t rstudio_session
```

## 🧩 Where to Start Today (Suggested First Steps)
1. **Set up the Conda dev environment** (you already have the YAML).
2. **Clone the repo and explore the pipeline structure**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nf-core/scdownstream.git
   cd scdownstream
   ```
3. **Pick a task based on your interest** (tool integration, species support, docs).
4. **Check the open issues / discussions tab on the repo**, or create your own task if it’s not listed.

## 🧠 List Of Tasks: Pick a Track

Here’s a breakdown of **what you can do to contribute**, based on your interests and experience level:

### 1. 🧪 **Tool Integration (e.g. scDblFinder)**
**Great if you like R, pipeline logic, and Nextflow.**
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with how `nf-core/scdownstream` currently handles doublet detection.
- [ ] Fork the repo and clone it locally.
- [ ] Add `scDblFinder` as a new doublet detection option:
  - Add it as a **new module** (check [`nf-core/modules`](https://github.com/nf-core/modules)).
  - Hook it into the pipeline config and `main.nf` logic.
- [ ] Test the module locally with mock/test data.
- [ ] Add an option in `params.schema.json` so users can select scDblFinder.

📚 Reference:
- [`nf-core/modules`](https://github.com/nf-core/modules)
- [`nf-core/tools` guide](https://nf-co.re/developers/adding_tools)

---

### 2. 🐭 **Mouse Species Support**
**Great if you're familiar with scRNA-seq or bioinformatics data formats.**
- [ ] Check if `nf-core/scdownstream` currently hardcodes human genome references or assumptions.
- [ ] Create/test a pipeline run using mouse data, e.g., from **Tabula Muris Senis**.
- [ ] Note any species-specific adjustments (annotation formats, gene IDs, marker gene lists).
- [ ] Suggest or implement generalizable species selection logic (e.g., via params).

---

### 3. 📖 **Improve Docs & Onboarding**
**Perfect if you want to help others and like writing clear instructions.**
- [ ] Walk through the current documentation from a new user's perspective.
- [ ] Identify anything that’s missing, confusing, or out of date.
- [ ] Add:
  - A contributor quickstart guide.
  - An example config for mouse data.
  - Code comments in newly added modules.

---

### 4. 🧪 **Testing + Validation**
**Ideal if you’re detail-oriented or new to contributing.**
- [ ] Pull the current pipeline branch and test it with provided input data.
- [ ] Try running `scDblFinder` manually in R on example datasets, compare it with the pipeline output.
- [ ] Help improve or expand unit tests and CI workflows.

---

## 🧰 Tools You’ll Be Using
- **Nextflow** for pipeline structure.
- **R** (especially for scDblFinder and Seurat/SCE workflows).
- **GitHub** for collaboration.
- **Docker** for reproducibility.
- **Markdown** for documentation.

# 🚀 Day 1 Report

## ✅ What we got done!

1. 🧐 Figured out how the doublet detection pipeline works
2. 🔁 Adaped the random based method of **scDblFinder** to the workflow

# To Dos 

1. 🔬 Adapt the [scDblFinder clustering based method](https://github.com/KurayiChawatama/scdownstream/blob/dev/modules/local/doublet_detection/scDblFinder/templates/scDblFinder_clusters.R) into a module. see [this example](https://github.com/KurayiChawatama/scdownstream/blob/dev/modules/local/doublet_detection/scDblFinder/templates/scDblFinder_random.R)
2. 🔗 Adapt the **random method's process** into the broader pipeline creating all the necessary auxilary files
3. 📥 Download and process (if necessary) **small annotated scRNAseq datasets** to use as test data
4. 🛠️ Create the docker image with all the dependencies needed for the **scDblFinder** package to work
5. 🐭 Move on to the Mouse annotation support!

Let's keep up the momentum! 💪🔥
